FAVencoder - Frame-Accurate Video Encoder

Overview

FAVencoder (Frame-Accurate Video Encoder) is a comprehensive video processing tool that combines traditional video encoding with AI-powered enhancement capabilities. Built on Python and FFmpeg, it provides both GUI and command-line interfaces for batch processing, frame-accurate editing, and intelligent video upscaling.

Installation

Choose the guide for your operating system.

For Windows, macOS, and Standard Linux Desktops

Core Prerequisites

· Python 3.8 or higher.
· FFmpeg: Must be installed on your system and available in your PATH.

Step 1: Install the System Graphical Dependency (Linux GUI Users Only)

· Windows/macOS: Tkinter is included with the standard Python installer. No action needed.
· Linux (for GUI mode): You must install the Tk library and its Python bindings at the system level. This is a prerequisite that cannot be installed via pip.
  ```
  # For Debian/Ubuntu:
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-tk
  # For Fedora/RHEL:
  sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
  ```

Step 2: Set Up an Isolated Python Environment

All subsequent Python packages should be installed inside a virtual environment.

1. Create and activate the environment:
   ```
   python -m venv favenv
   # Activate it:
   # Linux/macOS: source favenv/bin/activate
   # Windows: favenv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   (Your terminal prompt should change to start with (favenv).)
2. Install Core Python Packages via pip:
   With the environment active, use pip to install the latest versions.
   ```
   pip install opencv-python pillow numpy
   ```
   (Do not use sudo or system package managers for this step.)

Step 3: Install Optional AI Packages (Also via pip)

FAVencoder supports AI-powered video upscaling through two backends:

· CPU Backend (Recommended for testing): Install within your active virtual environment.
  ```
  pip install super-image
  ```
· GPU Backend (For faster processing): The application uses Real-ESRGAN-ncnn-vulkan, a standalone executable.
  · No manual installation is required. The program will automatically download the correct version for your operating system the first time you select a GPU AI enhancement option.
  · Requirement: A Vulkan-compatible GPU and drivers. This backend is disabled on ARM-based systems (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Apple Silicon Macs).

Quick Start Commands

Once your environment is set up and activated:

```
# Launch the graphical interface (default)
python favencoder.py
# Process jobs in the queue without the GUI
python favencoder.py --no-gui
```

For Android (Termux)

On Termux, all packages can be installed via the pkg manager.

1. Install Termux and All Dependencies
Install Termux from F-Droid. Then, install all dependencies in one step using pkg:

```
# Update the package list and upgrade existing packages
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y

# Install Python, FFmpeg, Tkinter, and all required Python libraries
pkg install python ffmpeg python-tkinter python-numpy python-pillow python-opencv
```

2. Install the AI Package (CPU Only)
The only package you should install via pip is the optional CPU-based AI module. Install it globally.

```
pip install super-image
```

Important Notes for Termux:

· No GPU Acceleration: The Real-ESRGAN GPU backend is not available on Android/Termux.
· Storage Access: You may need to grant Termux storage permissions (termux-setup-storage) to access video files outside its home directory.

Quick Start in Termux:

```
# Navigate to the directory containing favencoder.py
python favencoder.py
```
